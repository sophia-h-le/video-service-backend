# video-service-public
A purely backend CRUD application for video storage and retrieval.

It's built with Node, Express, MongoDB, and AWS S3.

I strived to follow REST API standard. 

### What I've learned
- If a project plans to have user authentication, implement it first.

- Document databases are really handy. Schemas can be adjusted as many times as needed.

- JavaScript is widely used so there's a high chance a service/api has it supported. 
Look it up before attempting to implement it yourself.
It will save you time, and also a guide on how the feature may be implemented.

- Invest time in writing tests. It's a good habit to have.
